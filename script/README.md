# Qiskit Quick Demonstration

## Overview

This Python code demonstrates the basics of quantum computing using Qiskit, IBM's open-source quantum computing framework. The demonstration includes examples of quantum circuit creation, simulation, and execution on a local simulator or IBM Quantum Experience's backends.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed
- Pip package manager
- Jupyter Notebook (optional for interactive demonstration)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/qiskit-quick-demo.git
cd qiskit-quick-demo
```

2. **Install required packages:**

```bash
pip install qiskit
```

## Usage

1. **Run the demonstration:**

```bash
python qiskit_demo.py
```

2. **Explore the Jupyter Notebook (optional):**

If you prefer an interactive demonstration, launch the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook qiskit_demo.ipynb
```

## Contents

- `qiskit_demo.py`: Python script demonstrating basic Qiskit functionalities.
- `qiskit_demo.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook version of the demonstration.
- `README.md`: This file.

## How to Use

The code in `qiskit_demo.py` covers the following aspects:
- Creating quantum circuits using Qiskit.
- Adding quantum gates (e.g., Hadamard, CNOT) to the circuit.
- Visualizing the circuit.
- Simulating the circuit on a local Qiskit simulator.
- Running the circuit on IBM Quantum Experience backends (requires IBM Quantum account and API token).

## Additional Notes

- **IBM Quantum Experience:** To run the code on IBM Quantum Experience's backends, sign up for an account at [IBM Quantum Experience](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/) and replace `YOUR_API_TOKEN` in the code with your actual API token.
- This demonstration is designed for educational purposes and showcases fundamental Qiskit functionalities. Feel free to modify and expand upon it for your specific quantum computing needs.
